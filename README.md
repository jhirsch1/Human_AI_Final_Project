# Human_AI_Final_Project

Contains files for the Human-AI final project 
## Error Free Trust-POMDP
This is the model based on the original "Planning with Trust for Human-Robot Collaboration" paper, that does not take into account the possibility of robot failue

## Error Prone Trust-POMDP
This is the novel model from this project, which does take into account the possibility of robot failure

## Raw Data and Analysis datasets
These are the datasets collected from the user study. The Analysis sheet contains cleaned data gathered from the raw data sheet and analysis tables over the data.

## STAN Models 
Contains two STAN models - trust dynamics and human behavior model  
These two models are not actually used by the project currently, but if the results from the user study were incorporated into the trust-POMDPs, these two models would be used to generate initial variable values to be used in the model creation.
